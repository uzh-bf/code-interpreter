/**
 * Persistent, stateful session workspace for the Lambda MicroVM backend.
 *
 * A session-bound VM runs exactly one runtime session, and its executions
 * serialize on the control-plane lock — so the runner keeps a single
 * long-lived workspace and a single pinned UID, reused by every `/execute`.
 * This is what turns the semi-stateless runner stateful: files, installed
 * packages, and chDB dirs under `/mnt/data` survive between calls instead of
 * being wiped per job.
 *
 * Gated by two independent locks (both required): the image-level
 * `SANDBOX_SESSION_WORKSPACE_ENABLED` (true only in the Lambda MicroVM runner
 * target) and a per-request opt-in. The control plane opts a VM into session
 * mode by stamping the derived runtime session id on every `/execute` via the
 * `X-Runtime-Session-Id` header (see `parseSessionBindingFromHeader`). When
 * neither lock is active, `getBoundSessionWorkspace()` returns undefined and
 * the runner falls back to the untouched fresh-per-job path.
 *
 * The header, not a `/run` lifecycle hook, is the delivery mechanism: Lambda's
 * image build hooks require the snapshot-compatible Lambda base container image
 * to route, and enabling any runtime hook forces the `/ready` build hook, which
 * never reaches a stock container's listener. Per-request signaling keeps image
 * builds hookless (reliable) and needs no snapshot handshake.
