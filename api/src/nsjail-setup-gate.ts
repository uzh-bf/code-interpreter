 * Serializes the unsafe portion of NsJail launches inside a single runner.

 * NsJail with `no_pivotroot: true` and no explicit chroot picks a host-shared
 * setup directory of the form `/tmp/nsjail.<orig_uid>.root`. Because the
 * runner runs as root (required by SANDBOX_PER_JOB_UIDS), every concurrent
 * NsJail child targets the same path: `/tmp/nsjail.0.root`. The bind-mount
 * inside each child's mount namespace is private, but the host directory
 * entry and the mkdir/chmod/bind sequence around it race.
 *
 * This gate guards only the spawn -> "mounts done" window. NsJail flushes
 * `[I] ... Executing "<bin>" for '...'` to its `--log` file immediately after
 * all mount setup completes and before exec(2). We hold the gate until that
 * marker appears or a watchdog timeout fires, then release so the job runs
 * its actual code in parallel with siblings. Throughput stays in the runner;
 * only the dangerous ~tens-of-ms window is serialized.
