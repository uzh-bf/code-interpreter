 * Sprint regression: the `/upload` (single) route was emitting
 * `session_id` while `/upload/batch` emitted `storage_session_id`.
 * LC's `uploadCodeEnvFile` reads `result.storage_session_id`, so
 * every chat-attach upload silently captured `undefined` and broke
 * the next /exec's file priming chain.
 *
 * These tests pin the wire-shape contract on both response types so
 * a future refactor can't quietly revert the rename — any drift
 * trips a TypeScript compile error inside the test, which Bun's
 * runner treats as a failure.
