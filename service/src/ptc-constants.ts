 * Returns `true` for any filename the submission layer must refuse.
 *
 * Two things make a name "reserved":
 *   1. Its post-normalization basename is `_ptc_history.json` — the single
 *      runtime fixture the replay preamble injects into the submission dir.
 *      Any user-supplied file with that exact basename would shadow our
 *      injected history and silently corrupt replay correctness, so we
 *      reject it on the request path. The bash preamble's `_ptc_pending.*`
 *      and `_ptc_counter.*` tempfiles live in `/tmp` and never reach the
 *      submission dir, so the wider `_ptc_*` prefix the previous version
 *      rejected was overreach: it broke legitimate user inputs like
 *      `_ptc_data.csv` that don't conflict with anything we write.
 *   2. The path tries to escape the submission directory via leading `../`
 *      after normalization. Traversal rejection lives here because any
 *      file that resolves to `_ptc_history.json` post-traversal would
 *      still clobber the runtime fixture, and factoring the two checks
 *      apart would let a caller smuggle one past the other.
 *
 * Normalization folds backslashes to `/`, drops empty and `.` segments,
 * resolves `..` by popping the accumulated path, and flags the name as
 * escaping if any `..` is applied below the root. The comparison is
 * against the basename of the resulting path.
 *
 * Examples (all return `true`):
 *   `_ptc_history.json`, `sub/../_ptc_history.json`,
 *   `..\\etc\\passwd`, `../../x.txt`.
 *
 * Examples (all return `false`):
 *   `_ptc_data.csv`, `_ptc_counter.XXXXXX`, `notes_ptc_history.json`.
