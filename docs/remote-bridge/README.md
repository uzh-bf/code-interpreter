# Remote Code Bridge

Remote Code Bridge makes an operator-owned VM a stateful Code API execution
environment without exposing that VM to inbound internet traffic.

For an end-to-end host setup, including pairing, named environments, systemd,
launchd, GitHub App credentials, upgrades, verification, and recovery, see the
[self-hosted worker runbook](./worker-runbook.md).

```text
LibreChat -> Code API -> Redis assignment
                         ^             |
                         | outbound    v
                    @librechat/code -> local sandbox
```

Code API remains the public authentication, policy, manifest, timeout, and
result-normalization boundary. The bridge worker has a separate operator
identity and never accepts end-user bearer tokens directly.

## Code API configuration

Run this as an isolated stateful Code API deployment:

```dotenv
CODEAPI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=remote-bridge
CODEAPI_EXECUTION_PROFILE=stateful
CODEAPI_RUNTIME_SESSION_MODE=affinity
CODEAPI_BRIDGE_WORKER_ID=my-vm
CODEAPI_BRIDGE_TOKEN=<strong-administrator-bootstrap-secret>
CODEAPI_BRIDGE_AUTH_MODE=paired
```

Use `strict` instead of `affinity` if every request must include a runtime
session hint. In hardened mode, startup requires the bridge token to be at least
32 bytes. `PTC_MODE=blocking` is rejected; replay mode is required because a
remote execution cannot retain an open Code API process across tool callbacks.

To attach multiple principal-owned workers to one Code API deployment, enable
dynamic routing. A compatibility default worker is optional in this mode:

```dotenv
CODEAPI_BRIDGE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS=true
CODEAPI_BRIDGE_AUTH_MODE=paired
# CODEAPI_BRIDGE_WORKER_ID=my-default-vm
```

Dynamic routing is accepted only with paired authentication. LibreChat signs
the selected worker into the short-lived Code API JWT as `code_worker_id`.
`X-LibreChat-Code-Worker-ID` remains the transport header, but Code API accepts
it only when it exactly matches that authenticated claim. The resolved worker
is persisted across the queue and programmatic replay boundaries, and Code API
requires both its stored tenant binding and registered worker credential before
creating a lease.

Create a single-use pairing code with the administrator secret:

```bash
curl -fsS https://code.example.com/v1/bridge/pairings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODEAPI_BRIDGE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"workerId":"my-vm"}'
```

With dynamic routing enabled, the trusted control plane must bind each pairing
to one tenant and generic principal. Code API treats the principal as lifecycle
and audit metadata; LibreChat remains responsible for resolving user, role, and
group membership before selecting the worker:

```bash
curl -fsS https://code.example.com/v1/bridge/pairings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CODEAPI_BRIDGE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "workerId":"user-vm",
    "binding":{
      "tenantId":"tenant-1",
      "principal":{"type":"user","id":"user-1"}
    }
  }'
```

Principal types are `deployment`, `tenant`, `user`, `role`, and `group`.
Pairing and registration bodies from the VM cannot replace the server-issued
binding, and credential rotation preserves it.

Redeem the returned code on the VM using
[`@librechat/code`](../../packages/code/README.md). The CLI generates its key
locally, proves possession on every request, and rotates its short-lived
credential before expiry. `CODEAPI_BRIDGE_AUTH_MODE=static` remains available
for non-hardened development compatibility only.

To expose an existing checkout as a worker-local workspace, start the CLI with
an explicit directory and logical ID:

```bash
librechat-code run \
  --worker-dir /srv/checkouts/librechat \
  --workspace-id primary \
  --workspace-name LibreChat
```

The worker advertises only the workspace ID, optional display name, and
supported operations. Its host path is never registered with Code API. An
authenticated caller can execute the initial read-only operations through:

```bash
curl -fsS https://code.example.com/v1/workspace-tools/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIBRECHAT_JWT" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "protocolVersion":1,
    "operation":"read_file",
    "workspaceId":"primary",
    "path":"README.md",
    "startLine":1,
    "maxLines":200
  }'
```

The endpoint uses the same authenticated principal-bound worker selection,
tenant fence, lease deadline, cancellation, and settlement lifecycle as remote
sandbox execution. Requests must name a workspace and operation advertised by
that worker. Results are validated against the originating request before they
leave Code API, and are bounded to 1 MiB/500 lines for reads, 200 matches for
searches, or 500 relative paths for file listings. Absolute paths, traversal,
backslashes, symlink escapes, unexpected fields, and host roots are rejected.

Workspace mutation remains disabled unless the operator starts the worker with
`--allow-workspace-writes` (or
`LIBRECHAT_CODE_ALLOW_WORKSPACE_WRITES=true`). That adds bounded `write_file`
and exact-match `edit_file` operations. Writes are limited to 1 MiB of UTF-8
text, require an existing in-workspace parent directory, reject symlinks, and
commit atomically. The worker capability is an enforcement boundary; LibreChat
should still route every mutation through its configurable tool-approval hooks.

The workspace root can be an existing project, a Git repository, or an empty
directory; Git is not required. This boundary keeps that directory local to the
operator's machine, but selected file contents, search matches, relative file
listings, and later tool results necessarily cross the outbound bridge to Code
API and the model.
Treat them as explicit tool outputs, apply the same retention and audit policy
as chat content, and do not register a directory containing secrets. The
default operations are read-only. Operators can explicitly add bounded
`execute_command` support with `--allow-workspace-commands` (or
`LIBRECHAT_CODE_ALLOW_WORKSPACE_COMMANDS=true`). The CLI prepares its sandbox
before registration, so Code API cannot dispatch commands to an unavailable
boundary. LibreChat's tool-approval hooks remain the per-call decision point.

The package exposes `SandboxWorkspaceTools` for composing that boundary without
ever invoking an unsandboxed host shell. It requires an explicit sandbox
implementation and an allowlist of workspace IDs, preserves per-workspace
operation restrictions, validates bounded results, and treats an unknown
command failure as an uncertain mutation.

Selected attached workspaces on macOS, Linux, and WSL2 can also advertise Bash
Programmatic Tool Calling. Native Windows workers do not advertise Bash PTC.
Code API then runs each replay iteration through the same workspace-scoped
native SRT executor. Source code operates in the selected local root, while
replay metadata, injected skills and attachments, and generated artifacts are
staged in an execution-private data directory and removed after settlement.
Only authorized file references and returned artifacts cross the relay; the
repository is never uploaded to Code API. This capability is advertised only
when native SRT commands and a file-relay upstream are both configured, so
older or partially configured workers continue to fail closed.

Native SRT is the MVP and default command backend on a user's chosen laptop or
VM. It uses Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap/seccomp on Linux, and the SRT
restricted-account helper on Windows. It confines writes to the registered
workspace, denies reads of the worker home and control files, strips worker
credentials, and denies network egress by default. Startup fails closed when
the platform dependencies are unavailable; there is no unsandboxed fallback.
Use `LIBRECHAT_CODE_COMMAND_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` for an explicit comma-separated
egress allowlist.
Linux hosts must provide `bubblewrap`, `socat`, and `ripgrep`; macOS uses
system facilities. Bash Programmatic Tool Calling additionally requires Bash
5.2 or newer and `jq` on `PATH` on macOS, Linux, and WSL2. The worker resolves
the compatible shell from `PATH` rather than assuming `/bin/bash`. Windows
requires SRT's one-time restricted-account setup.

The optional `docker-nsjail` adapter enables a stronger container boundary with
`--allow-workspace-commands` (or
`LIBRECHAT_CODE_ALLOW_WORKSPACE_COMMANDS=true`) and a registered worker/default
directory. It mounts only the canonical workspace, keeps the runner port
unpublished, authenticates its dedicated command route with an ephemeral
container capability, and runs Bash inside the existing NsJail profile. Direct
endpoint mode cannot be used as the `runtime` command backend, but endpoint
runtime supervision can coexist with native SRT commands. Set
`LIBRECHAT_CODE_COMMAND_SANDBOX=runtime` to select Docker/NsJail explicitly.
This deployment permission does not replace the per-call approval decision:
LibreChat must apply its configurable tool-approval hooks before dispatching
`execute_command`.

Stateful deployments must also set `LIBRECHAT_CODE_STATEFUL_WORKSPACE=true`
and route the CLI's `{runtimeSessionId}` endpoint template to an isolated,
persistent local runner per session. A single sandbox endpoint is stateless and
is rejected for runtime-session assignments.

## LibreChat configuration

Expose the Code API deployment as an environment under the Agents endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
    agents:
        statefulCodeSessions:
            allowedEnvironments: [user, agent-user, conversation]
            environments:
                - id: my-vm
                  name: My VM
                  type: attached
                  baseURL: https://code.example.com/v1
                  default: true
```

Agents may select this environment with `code_environment_id: my-vm`.
LibreChat derives a stable per-conversation runtime session ID, so commands in
later turns reuse the same workspace. Attached environments deliberately skip
background prewarming: the single worker lease is reserved for explicit user
execution.

## Lifecycle and fencing

- Registration is ephemeral in Redis and must be refreshed by the worker.
- Pairing codes are stored hashed, expire after ten minutes, and are consumed
  atomically on their first redemption attempt.
- Worker credentials expire after fifteen minutes and are bound to an Ed25519
  public key. Exact-request signatures include the HTTP method, path, body
  digest, timestamp, nonce, and credential.
- Accepted proof nonces cannot be replayed, credentials rotate before expiry,
  and an administrator can revoke the active worker identity immediately.
- Assignment leases bind to a stable paired identity rather than an individual
  short-lived credential. Rotation preserves that identity; pairing again
  replaces it and fences work queued for the previous owner.
- Remote bridge deployments use backend-specific BullMQ queues and serialize
  the expected backend on every new job, preventing Lambda or HTTP consumers
  from accepting attached-worker executions.
- Code API permits one active assignment per worker.
- Dynamic workers are fenced to their server-issued tenant before assignment.
- Each assignment has an absolute deadline, generation, and random lease token.
- Settlements with the wrong worker, generation, token, or expired deadline are
  rejected.
- Assignments are queued for the exact registered worker incarnation, so an
  outstanding poll from a replaced process cannot consume replacement work.
- Assignment records and the worker lock live through the full configured job
  deadline plus cleanup grace.
- Ambiguous settlement delivery is retried through the assignment deadline. If
  a stateful settlement remains ambiguous, the CLI exits and the affected local
  session runner must be reset or discarded before restart.
- Enqueueing stateful work atomically creates a durable in-flight workspace
  marker. A definite rejection or successful result finalization clears it;
  worker or VM loss leaves it in place so later reuse fails closed. Settlement
  receipts outlive assignment cleanup briefly so retries are idempotent and
  cannot recreate a cleared marker.
- To recover a fenced session, stop the normal worker process and discard/reset
  that session's local sandbox workspace. While it remains stopped, run
  `librechat-code reset-workspace <runtime-session-id>` with the same worker
  configuration; the command temporarily registers its own incarnation and
  exits. Start the normal worker only after the reset command succeeds. Code API
  refuses the acknowledgement while work is active or when it is not made by
  the currently registered incarnation.
- Request cancellation is polled by the worker and aborts the local sandbox
  request.
- Replay PTC clients may attach a fresh `X-LibreChat-Code-Request-ID` to each
  `/exec/programmatic` request and send that same opaque ID to
  `POST /v1/exec/programmatic/cancel`. Code API binds the short-lived request
  record to the authenticated principal, durably marks cancellation in Redis,
  and publishes it to the worker process holding the BullMQ job. This explicit
  path avoids relying on HTTP connection teardown, frees waiting jobs
  immediately, and interrupts active remote-bridge assignments without polling
  once per active job.
  Cancellation and completed-result publication use an atomic Redis decision:
  a late cancel returns `already_completed` instead of acknowledging Stop after
  completion won. Ambiguous enqueue/cancellation errors retain replay ownership
  until a durable fence or the original job deadline. Completed results are
  retained temporarily (bounded to 16 MiB) so a lost BullMQ completion reply
  does not cause sandbox effects to be repeated. Reconnect reconciliation reads
  only small status markers, using one subscriber per process.
  Roll out the matching Code API queue-worker processes before enabling this
  endpoint on API replicas; pre-cancellation workers do not observe its markers.
- A leased assignment remains in a Redis-backed delivery claim until the worker
  explicitly acknowledges it; reconnecting before acknowledgement redelivers
  the same fenced assignment instead of losing it after an HTTP disconnect.
- The sandbox receives the stable runtime session ID separately from the lease;
  workspace state belongs to that session, not to a transient assignment.

## Security boundaries

The bridge removes inbound VM exposure; it does not replace sandbox isolation.
For internet-facing LibreChat deployments, use the hardened microVM/NsJail
stack, default-deny sandbox egress, signed execution manifests, least-privilege
host credentials, resource limits, and host/network monitoring. Bind the local
sandbox endpoint to loopback or a private container network. Rotate a leaked
administrator token immediately. Pairing secures worker transport identity; it
cannot attest that a compromised VM truthfully reports or enforces its sandbox
capabilities.

LibreChat's owner-scoped environment registry can issue these principal-bound
pairings without changing the worker execution protocol or moving code tools
into the Agents SDK.
